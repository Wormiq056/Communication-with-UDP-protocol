This is an explanation of my protocol. I decided to implement this by a system that first client sends a packet with information
about the next packet that will contain data and a server has to acknowledge both the first message and also the data message
If that doesnt happen the server will requests to recieve the message again

PACKET:

|packet type|msg type|frag num|msg length|data|
packet type (2 bytes) = ACK, FIN, HEADER, DATA
msg type (2 bytes) = FILE, TEXT, NONE, FAIL
frag num (5 bytes) = num of current fragment that is beeing sent
msg length (4 bytes) = length of data part
data (0-1000 bytes )= actuall data we want to sent

HEADER-SIZE = 13 B


----packet type----
ACK = 00
FIN = 01
HEADER = 10
DATA = 11

----msg type----
NONE = 00
TXT = 01
FILE = 10
FAIL = 11

---frag num----
just a number x  (0 <x> 100000)

---msg length---
number greater than 0 and lower than 1001

---data---
actuall data beeing sent
max length 1000bytes
